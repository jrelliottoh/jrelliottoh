- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrelliottoh
- 👀 I’m interested in thermophysical properties like: critical temperature, critical pressure, critical volume, heat capacity, dipole moment, pressure, vapor pressure, virial coefficients, compressibility, energy, entropy, fugacity, solubility, viscosity, thermal conductivity, diffusivity, and interfacial tension.  I use tools like: equations of state, cluster diagram expansions, thermodynamic perturbation theory, Wertheim's theory and the SAFT methodology, integral equation theory, quasichemical theory, molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation, quantum density functional theory, and classical density functional theory. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, MOSDEF, GAMESS, GitHub...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on methods and properties like the above, especially as they relate to The Properties of Gases and Liquids.
